# **Unity Software Additional Terms**
 
 
 
 
### **These terms govern your use of Unity Pro (including, if applicable, with your Unity Enterprise Plan), Unity Plus, and Unity Personal.**
 
Last Updated March 10, 2022
 
Your use of the Unity Software is subject to these Additional Terms (the “Software Terms”), which supplement and are incorporated into the [Unity Terms of Service](https://unity.com/legal/terms-of-service).  By downloading, installing or using the Unity Software in any manner, you represent and affirm that you have read, understand and agree to be legally bound by and comply with these Software Terms.  If you do not agree with these Software Terms, you are not authorized to use the Unity Software in any manner.
 
 
## **Tier Eligibility**
 
You and everyone using the Unity Software on your behalf must be Tier Eligible at all times.  “Tier Eligible” means that your Total Finances cannot exceed the defined Financial Thresholds for the tier of Unity Software you (or those providing services to you) are using.  Tier Eligibility is measured for the most recent twelve (12) month period.  If you are mid-project, and your Total Finances grow to exceed the Financial Threshold of the Unity Software tier you are using, you do not need to start from scratch - you can simply upgrade your license and continue working. How we measure your Total Finances varies based on who you are.  Financial Thresholds are shown in US currency and your Total Finances will be converted to US currency to determine your Tier Eligibility.
 
 
### **Total Finances are measured like this:**
 
 
 
* if you are a Legal Entity using the Unity Software (other than to provide services to someone else), your Total Finances are your gross revenues and/or funding (no matter what the source), or, if you are a Not-for-Profit Entity, your budget for the entire entity (not just the department using the Software),
* If you are an individual or a Legal Entity providing services to a third party, your Total Finances is deemed to be your customer or client’s Total Finances, and
* if you are an individual using the Unity Software, but not providing services to a third party, your Total Finances are the amount generated in connection with your use of the Unity Software. In this case, your Total Finances would not include amounts you generate from other work (for example, if your day job is as a zookeeper).
 
By using the Unity Software, you represent and warrant that you are Tier Eligible to use the tier of Unity Software you are using and those being used on your behalf.  You understand that it is your responsibility to maintain complete records establishing your Tier Eligibility and you bear the burden of proving your Tier Eligibility if we ask.    
 
 
### **Financial Thresholds:**
 
 
 
* The Financial Threshold for Unity Personal is US $100,000 for the most recent twelve (12) month period.  To be Tier Eligible to use Unity Personal, your Total Finances may not exceed US $100,000.  If your Total Finances exceed US $100,000 you may not use Unity Personal at all, even for internal projects or prototyping.   
* The Financial Threshold for Unity Plus is US $ 200,000 for the most recent twelve (12) month period. To be Tier Eligible to use Unity Plus, your Total Finances may not exceed US $200,000.  If your Total Finances exceed $200,000, you may only use Unity Pro.
* There is no Financial Threshold for Unity Pro. You do not need to be Tier Eligible to use Unity Pro; Unity Pro may be used by anyone who pays the applicable subscription fees.
 
For clarity, these Financial Thresholds apply whether or not you use the Unity Software as part of a Unity Plan.
 
 
### **No Mixing or Co-mingling:**
 
Unity Software tiers with different Financial Thresholds may not be used at the same time by one entity or individual or for or on behalf of one entity or individual.  You must upgrade all subscriptions if your Total Finances exceed a Financial Threshold. Unity reserves the right to disable your use of the Unity Software if you attempt to use two tiers simultaneously. If you are using Unity Pro and want to provide services to a customer or client who is Tier Eligible to use Unity Plus, contact us and we will give you an exception.
 
Unity may monitor your compliance with and enforce these restrictions and requirements, including but not limited to monitoring the number of downloads of your Project Content, and any available revenue estimate data.
 
Unity Personal users may be required to complete a user survey in order to activate the Unity Software.
 
 
## **1. Rights to use the Unity Software.**
 
 
### **1.1 Use Rights.**
 
Conditioned upon your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and payment of all applicable subscription fees, Unity grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free right: (a) to install and execute the executable form of the authoring environment provided by the Unity Software (the “Unity Editor”), solely for internal use by a single person to develop your Project Content during the applicable term (the “Unity Editor Rights”); and (b) if you are using a version of the Unity Software other than an educational version, to distribute the runtime portion of the Unity Software intended for distribution as an integrated part of your Project Content (the “Unity Runtime”), solely as embedded or incorporated into your Project Content, and solely to third parties to whom you license or sell your Project Content or who provide you with Third Party Services, in each case pursuant to an agreement that is no less protective of Unity and its licensors than this Agreement (the “Unity Runtime Rights”).  If you are a Legal Entity, you may allow affiliated entities or third party contractors who are testing, developing and operating your Project Content on your behalf (each, a “Designated User”), to exercise your Unity Editor Rights and Unity Runtime Rights on your behalf. You may allow distributors who are licensing or selling your Project Content and Third Party Service providers providing you a Third Party Service to exercise your Unity Runtime Rights on your behalf.  In all cases you remain responsible for your distributors', Third Party Service providers' and Designated Users’ compliance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement or any breach thereof.   All use of the Unity Software, including any third party exercise of your rights under this paragraph, is subject to this Agreement, including any restrictions set forth below, and you may not otherwise allow third parties to use the rights granted in this Agreement.
 
As part of the Unity Software, Unity may include or make available a mechanism for installing, upgrading, configuring and removing Packages for use with the Unity Software (the “Unity Package Manager”), which may be used in accordance with the Unity Editor Rights set forth above. Additionally, Unity grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free right to deliver or otherwise make Packages available within the Unity Editor, including via the Unity Package Manager, subject at all times to the Unity Editor Rights, and provided you comply with [Unity’s Package Guidelines](https://unity.com/legal/terms-of-service/software/package-guidelines).  You may not otherwise make Packages available within the Unity Editor. 
 
If you do make Packages available within the Unity Editor as authorized herein, you represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights in and to any such Packages, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold Unity harmless for any claims involving such Packages, and Unity expressly disclaims any and all liability for such Packages.  Without limitation of other rights that Unity has, including those set forth in Section 7 of the[ Terms of Service](https://unity.com/legal/terms-of-service), Unity will have the right in its sole discretion, and without prior notice, to disable or suspend access to a Package in order to stop or prevent a violation of this Section or the Package Guidelines.  
 
Unity may automate delivery of certain Unity-authorized Packages within the Unity Editor.  Your use of a Package may be subject to separate or additional terms and conditions and/or privacy policy, as indicated in such Package.
 
 
### **1.2 Unity Plans.**
 
Your Unity Plan includes one (1) subscription to use the Unity Software designated for that Unity Plan as well as the Plan Benefits available with that Unity Plan.  Your use of Unity Software as part of your Unity Plan is, accordingly, subject to all rights and restrictions set forth herein with respect to the applicable tier of the Unity Software, unless explicitly modified by this Section 1.2.  
 
Click[ here](https://store.unity.com/compare-plans?currency=USD) to see the specific Plan Benefits associated with your Unity Plan. Unity may modify Plan Benefits from time to time in its sole discretion. 
 
Your Plan Benefits may include certain Unity Services, Unity Toolkits, standalone third party software, and/or the right to add on other Unity offerings, like Unity’s Integrated Success Services, Professional Services or a license to access the Unity source code.  Access to Plan Benefits is subject to separate terms and conditions applicable to such benefits (as stated in Unity’s [Terms of Service](https://unity.com/legal/terms-of-service), on Unity’s [Legal Information page](https://unity.com/legal), or as otherwise provided to you by Unity) and may incur additional fees.  
 
Any Unity Software subscription designated in Unity’s systems as part of a “floating” Unity Plan may be used on multiple devices and shared globally among multiple Unity Editor users, subject to the following: the number of concurrent Unity Software users may not, at any given time, exceed your total number of floating Unity Plan subscriptions (whether such users are using the Unity Software offline or on a dedicated basis or otherwise).

### **1.4 Unity Toolkits.**
 
If Unity provides you with a Unity Toolkit, you may access and use such Unity Toolkit exclusively for use with the Unity Software and not in a standalone capacity.  If Unity provides you with the source code for a Unity Toolkit, then Unity grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free right to use, reproduce and modify such source code for the sole purpose of developing your Project Content, and to publish and distribute your modifications to such source code in binary form to third parties as a component part, but not the primary functionality, of your Project Content. You are solely responsible for any modifications you make to a Unity Toolkit, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold Unity harmless for any claims involving such modifications, and Unity expressly disclaims any and all liability for a modified Unity Toolkit. 
 
 
### **1.5 Build License. **
 
Notwithstanding these Software Terms, the following applies if you purchase Unity’s “Build License” subscription through special arrangement with Unity:
 
Your Build License subscription includes one (1) subscription to use Unity Pro.  Subject to your continued compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Unity grants you a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right during the applicable subscription term to install that copy of Unity Pro on up to ten (10) internal build machines, and you may use that copy for the sole purposes of publishing and distributing, but not creating, your Project Content. Your use of Unity Pro as part of your Build License subscription is subject to all rights and restrictions set forth herein with respect to Unity Pro, unless explicitly modified by this Section 1.5.
 
For clarity, you must purchase a separate "Unity Build Server" subscription in order to use Unity Build Server, subject to the [Unity Build Server Terms](https://unity.com/legal/terms-of-service/build-server). These Software Terms do not apply to your use of Unity Build Server.
 
 
### **1.6 HMI Platform Deployment.**
 
Notwithstanding these Software Terms, the following applies if you purchase Unity’s “HMI Platform Deployment” subscription:
 
Conditioned upon your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and payment of all applicable subscription fees, Unity grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable right during the applicable term to integrate and embed the Unity Runtime into a specified number of vehicles or other human transport mechanisms developed by or for you (the “Licensed Devices”) , solely in order to power, design or implement the human machine interface (HMI) of such Licensed Devices. For clarity, the person or entity who wishes to integrate and embed the Unity Runtime into more than 1,000 devices to power, design or implement the HMI must purchase HMI Platform Deployment in order to do so; otherwise they are in violation of Section 2.3 below (Embedded Software Restriction). If you are using Unity Software to power a third party’s HMI, the third party will be required to purchase HMI Platform Deployment.  
 
You acknowledge and agree that: (a) the Unity Software is a tool in accordance with Section 1.9 below (Unity Software is a Tool), and you represent and warrant that you will comply with your obligations set forth in Section 1.9, (b) you are responsible for the implementation of any required certifications, fail-safe mechanisms, safety testing and hardware testing related to your HMI Platform Deployment, and (c) the Unity Software is software, and so may not be free of bugs.
 
Use of any Unity product by you or on your behalf as embedded software in any other devices or systems other than the Licensed Devices (including, for example, machinery) as described herein will be subject to separate terms and fees.
 
 
 
 
### **1.7 Copies of Unity Software.**
 
Unless you have purchased a floating Unity Enterprise Plan or a Unity Build Server subscription, you (and your Designated Users) may install the Unity Editor on both a primary and a secondary computer or operating system, solely for your convenience, but only for use by a single person. You may make a single copy of the Unity Editor solely for backup or archival purposes. For the sake of clarity, you (or your Designated User) may only use one installation at any given time. Unity may in its sole discretion authorize you to install the Unity Editor on additional computers or operating systems upon deactivation of the Unity Editor installed on existing computers. For clarity, in no event may Third Party Service providers directly or indirectly distribute, run or use the Unity Editor so that it is executed on or simulated by the cloud or a remote server and transmitted over the Internet or other network except where they are acting on your behalf as a Designated User in accordance with this Section 1.6.
 
 
### **1.8 Third Party Requirements.  **
 
Unity Software natively supports multiple third party Platforms (i.e., the Unity Supported Platforms). 
 
Use of Unity Software with certain third party Unity Supported Platforms may require a current Unity Pro subscription and may be subject to additional technical requirements and/or terms and conditions (collectively, the “Closed Platform Requirements”), which may be accessed [here](https://unity.com/features/multiplatform) or provided directly by the third party platform providers. In addition, certain third party Unity Supported Platforms may require the use of “Preferred Platform” keys to enable use of Unity Software with that platform.  Access to such Preferred Platform keys may be obtained via the platform provider or Unity, as applicable.
 
You acknowledge and agree that while Unity Software may support a specific Unity Supported Platform, project publishers, including publishers affiliated with such Unity Supported Platform(s), may mandate adoption of additional technical requirements or other standards, which Unity Software may not support.
 
 
### **1.9 Unity Software is a Tool.**
 
Unity Software products are tools and are intended only to assist you with your design, analysis, simulation, testing and other activities and are not a substitute for your professional judgment or your own independent design, analysis, simulation, testing or other activities. Due to the large variety of potential applications for Unity Software, they have not been designed or tested for any specific uses, and it is your responsibility to determine whether the use of Unity Software is appropriate for the purposes you pursue. Unity will not be responsible or liable in any manner whatsoever for the results obtained through use of Unity Software, including any Project Content, or for the operation of any mechanism or device that is used in connection with Unity Software or the Project Content. You are responsible for your (including your authorized users’) use of Unity Software and any results produced by Unity Software, including any Project Content. You are also responsible for establishing the adequacy of independent procedures for testing the reliability, accuracy, completeness, compliance with applicable legal requirements, and other characteristics of any Project Content or its operation, including, without limitation, all items designed with the assistance of Unity Software. You further acknowledge that Unity Software and your Project Content may not achieve the results you desire within your design, analysis, simulation, testing and other constraints.
 
Where your use of Unity Software for Project Content is related to (i) the process of creation, manufacture, distribution or operation of physical products or materials including, but not limited to, automobiles, airplanes, ships, buildings, tools or machines, or (ii) any other physical use impacting the safety or security of persons or property, the following applies: in addition to any other indemnification obligation(s) you have under the Agreement, you will further indemnify, hold harmless and defend Unity from all claims, defense costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses), agreed settlements and finally awarded judgements arising out of any violation by you (or any of your agents) of any applicable safety law, regulation or industry standard applicable, or any damage to persons or property connected with your Project Content.
 
 
### **1.10 Third Party Software.**
 
The Unity Software incorporates or is bundled with Third Party Software governed by separate terms, including open source licenses. Such Third Party Software terms are identified in the LEGAL.TXT file bundled with the Unity Software and incorporated into this Agreement by reference. To the extent that any Third Party Software is incorporated or bundled within a Package distributed via the Unity Package Manager, the terms of such Third Party Software are identified in the Unity Package Manager license documentation. 
 
You agree that you have reviewed and accepted all applicable Third Party Software terms and that your use of the Unity Software and/or any Package will be deemed acceptance of such Third Party Software terms.
 
 
## **2. Restrictions.**
 
 
### **2.1 Unity Software Tier Restrictions.**
 
You acknowledge and agree that, as an express condition to the rights granted under Section 1, you (and those using the Unity Software on your behalf or in order to provide services to you): (i) may only use one (1) Unity Software tier at a time (e.g., if you purchase a subscription to use Unity Pro, then you and those working on your behalf may only use Unity Pro subscriptions on your behalf); and (ii) are not permitted to combine or integrate any of your Project Content developed with one tier of the Unity Software with any of your Project Content developed simultaneously with another tier.  For the avoidance of doubt: (a) if you are Tier Eligible to use Unity Personal, you may commence a project using only Unity Personal and subsequently upgrade all (but not less than all) of your subscriptions to Unity Plus (if you are Tier Eligible to do so) or Unity Pro; and (b) any user of the Unity Software may use content properly acquired from the Unity Asset Store regardless of the tier of Unity Software that was used to develop such Asset Store content.  You acknowledge and agree that Unity may tag your Project Content with an identifier to prevent any such unauthorized combination of your Project Content.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, if you subscribe to a Unity Plan designated in Unity’s systems as an “Enterprise” Unity Plan or the “Industrial Collection,” you may combine or integrate Project Content developed with either such Unity Plan.  
 
 
### **2.2 Educational Product Restrictions.**
 
If you are using an educational version of the Unity Software through the Unity Education Grant License Program or via a subscription to Unity EdLab, your right to use the Unity Editor and distribute the Unity Runtime in your Project Content is limited to educational, non-commercial purposes.  Unity may include a watermark designating that your Project Content was created using the education version of the Unity Software.   
 
 
### **2.3 Embedded Software Restriction.**
 
You may not directly or indirectly distribute your Project Content installed on more than 1,000 electronic devices or systems if your Project Content provides the user interface or primary functionality of such electronic device or system without a separate grant of rights from Unity. This restriction does not prevent you from distributing your Project Content pre-installed on personal computers and consumer electronic devices such as mobile phones, tablets, televisions or set top boxes as long as your Project Content does not provide the user interface or primary functionality of such device.
 
 
### **2.4 Working with Third Party Service Providers.**
 
Unity developers are free to use any service offered to Unity developers (each, a “Third Party Service”).  Unity does not have any obligation to provide support for any Third Party Service provider or Third Party Service under this Agreement.
 
Third Party Service providers may not, without Unity’s express written permission: (1) use a stylized version of any Unity name, trademark, logos, images or product icons, or other Unity-owned graphic symbols; (2) use a product name confusingly similar to a Unity product or that could be construed by Unity developers as being a Unity product or service; or (3) create or use any marketing materials that suggest an affiliation with, or endorsement by, Unity.  All use of Unity’s trademarks must comply with [Unity’s Trademark Guidelines](https://unity.com/legal/branding_trademarks).
 
 
### **2.5 Gambling Restriction.**
 
You may not develop, distribute or publish any of your Project Content in connection with any Gambling Activities without a separate grant of rights from Unity.
 
 
### **2.6 General Restrictions.**
 
Except as expressly specified in this Agreement, you may not: (a) copy (except in the course of loading or installing) or modify or create derivative works of the Unity Software; (b) distribute, transfer, sublicense, lease, lend, rent or otherwise provide access to the Unity Software to any third party; (c) directly or indirectly make the functionality of the Unity Software available to multiple users or third parties through any means, including but not limited to by uploading the Unity Software to a network or file-sharing service or through any hosting, application services provider, service bureau, software-as-a-service (SaaS) or any other technology or service; (d) use the Unity Software for competitive analysis or to develop a competing product or service; or (e) do anything that could cause or result in the Unity Software (including the runtime portion thereof) being subject to any open source license (or similar license) that requires as a condition of use, modification or distribution that the Unity Software (including the runtime portion thereof) or other software combined or distributed with the Unity Software be: (i) disclosed or distributed in source code form; (ii) licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or (iii) redistributable at no charge. You acknowledge and agree that portions of the Unity Software, including but not limited to the source code and the specific design and structure of individual modules or programs, are confidential and constitute or contain trade secrets of Unity and its licensors. Accordingly, you agree not to disassemble, decompile, modify or reverse engineer the Unity Software, in whole or in part, or permit or authorize a third party to do so, except to the extent such activities are expressly permitted by this Agreement or by law notwithstanding this prohibition. Notwithstanding the restriction prohibiting decompiling in the immediately preceding sentence, you may decompile the Unity Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) assemblies solely to inspect their functionality for purposes of understanding or improving performance of your Project Content or any editor extension to the Unity Software.
 
 
## **3. Consent to Data Collection; Privacy Policy Obligations.**
 
 
### **3.1 Data Collection**
 
You acknowledge and accept Unity's privacy policy. You agree that the Unity Software (including the Unity runtime in your Project Content) may send data to Unity to: (a) check for Unity Software updates; (b) provide aggregated usage statistics of your use of the Unity Software and the use of your Project Content by end users; (c) provide optional Developer Services; and (d) validate subscriptions in order to prevent unauthorized use. You acknowledge and agree that Unity may deliver messages and contact you about the Unity Software and other Unity product and service offerings.
 
 
### **3.2 Obligations**
 
You agree, and will ensure by obtaining all required consents in accordance with applicable law, that Unity has the right to receive, collect, retain and use data collected from your end users in accordance with  [Unity's privacy policy](https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy), which may be updated from time to time.
 
 
## **4. Support.**
 
You may access the online forums and the Unity Answers knowledge base through the Site. You may also email support@unity3d.com for assistance with your seats. Technical support may be offered by Unity at its sole discretion as described on the Unity website. You acknowledge and agree that Unity has no obligation under this Agreement to provide patches, updates, new releases or new versions of the Unity Software.
 
 
## **5. Term.**
 
Subscriptions for the Unity Software will remain in effect for the initial subscription period, and thereafter such subscription will automatically renew in accordance with your original payment frequency and commitment period at the then-current list price for such plan, or as otherwise authorized by Unity, unless you select a different available renewal option (i.e., payment frequency and/or commitment period) in your account (for subscriptions purchased online), otherwise change or renew your subscription plan, or terminate and cancel it as described in Section 7 of the Unity [Terms of Service](https://unity.com/legal/terms-of-service) prior to the end of your current commitment period.  For clarity, subscriptions for the Unity Software are not cancelable during the applicable subscription term and are non-refundable. Upon termination, you must at Unity’s option either promptly delete and destroy or return to Unity all copies of the Unity Software in your possession or control.
 
Paid in full, perpetual seats will remain in effect unless earlier terminated in accordance with the Agreement.
 
 
## **6. U.S. Government Rights.**
 
The Unity Software and computer software documentation (“Documentation”) are “commercial items” as that term is defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”) 2.101, consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” respectively, as such terms are used in FAR 12.212 and DFARS 227.7202. If acquired by or on behalf of a civilian agency, the U.S. Government acquires or will acquire the Unity Software and/or Documentation and other technical data subject to the terms of this Agreement as required in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Computer Software) and 12.211 (Technical Data) of the FAR and its successors. If acquired by or on behalf of any agency within the Department of Defense (“DOD”), the U.S. Government acquires or will acquire the Unity Software and/or Documentation subject to the terms of this Agreement as specified in 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-3 of the DOD FAR Supplement (“DFARS”) and its successors. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFARS, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software or technical data.
 
 
## **7. Export Law.**
 
You agree to comply fully with all export laws and regulations to ensure that neither the Unity Software nor any technical data related thereto nor any direct product thereof are exported or re-exported directly or indirectly in violation of, or used for any purposes prohibited by, such laws and regulations.
 
 
## **8. Modifications.**
 
Unity may update these Unity Software Additional Terms at any time for any reason and without notice (the “Updated Terms”) and those Updated Terms will apply to the most recent current-year version of the Unity Software, provided that, if the Updated Terms adversely impact your rights, you may elect to continue to use any current-year versions of the Unity Software (e.g., 2018.x and 2018.y and any Long Term Supported (LTS)  versions for that current-year release) according to the terms that applied just prior to the Updated Terms (the “Prior Terms”). The Updated Terms will then not apply to your use of those current-year versions unless and until you update to a subsequent year version of the Unity Software (e.g. from 2019.4 to 2020.1).  If material modifications are made to these Terms, Unity will endeavor to notify you of the modification. If a modification is required to comply with applicable law, the modification will apply notwithstanding this section.  Except as explicitly set forth in this paragraph, your use of any new version or release of the Unity Software will be subject to the Updated Terms applicable to that release or version.  You understand that it is your responsibility to maintain complete records establishing your entitlement to Prior Terms.
